# Introduction

This repository contains code and information for several Matlab exercises that highlight some of the concepts will be presented in the tutorial on Dynamical system bases learning from demonstrations at RSS 2016.

Each exercise has its own dependencies and recommended to follow the corresponding the readme files. Namely [This](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/RSS2018Tutorial/blob/master/Exercise_1/README.md), for the first exercise,  [This](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/RSS2018Tutorial/blob/master/Exercise_2/README.md), for the second exercise and [This](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/RSS2018Tutorial/blob/master/Exercise_3/README.md), for the third exercise.

The code for these exercises is compatible with MATLAB versions **R2015a-2017a**. Although It might be compatible with the other versions, we have only tested them with MATLAB versions **R2015a-2017a**.
